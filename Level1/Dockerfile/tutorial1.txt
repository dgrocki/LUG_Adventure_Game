							Tutorial 1: pwd, ls, and cd 

# NOTE: Before executing any of the steps below, read the entire lesson!

1. The pwd command can be run at any time, giving you an absolute path telling you where you currently are. pwd stands for "print working directory". 

2. The command 'ls' is one of the most useful. ls lists all of the files and directories at your current location. There are several different situations where you can use use ls, as well as several flags that give additional information about the files and directories listed.

3. First, ls can be used by itself to list any files and/or directories that are present in your current working directory. 

4. You can also run ls with a directory as an argument. This will list all the files and subdirectories within that directory. 

										e.g. ls <directory>

5. ls can also be run with different flags. We will discuss: -l and -a 
'ls -l' displays a longer version of the ls output, including more information about each file and directory present.

6. Another flag is the -a flag. 'ls -a' will list any hidden files or directories. Hidden files and directories are preceded with a '.' 

										e.g. .hidden_file

7. The last command for this tutorial is 'cd'. cd stands for "change directory". By itself, cd will by default bring you back to your home directory. 

8. cd also takes an argument. When given a directory (that exists in your current working directory) as an argument, it will move you to that directory. 

										e.g. cd <directory>

9. 'cd ..' takes you up a directory (back in your path!). This dot pattern can be repeated multiple times, separated by a '/' to go up as many directories as you want.

										e.g. cd ../../../ will take you 3 directories up

10. Congrats! You are now done with tutorial 1. Now you have the basic tools you need to begin exploring. Now go forth and adventure!
